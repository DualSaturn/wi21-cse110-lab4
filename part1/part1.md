1. At line 11, the last value of `i` will be printed, which will be equal to `prices.length`. This is because `i` was declared using the `var` keyword, and therefore has the entire function as its scope.
2. At line 12, the value of `discountedPrice` calculated during the last iteration of the loop will be printed. This is because `discountedPrice` was declared using the `var` keyword, and therefore has the entire function as its scope.
3. At line 13, the value of `finalPrice` calculated during the last iteration of the loop will be printed. This is because `finalPrice` was declared using the `var` keyword and was declared in the function's block. Therefore, it has the entire function as its scope.
4. The function will return `[50, 100, 150]`. This is because the variable `discounted` is initialized as an empty array. Then for each iteration of the loop, the discount is applied to the price and the final rounded price is pushed to the back of the array.
5. At line 11, we will get a ReferenceError, since `i` was declared using the `let` keyword inside the for loop. The `console.log` statement is outside the for loop, and is therefore outside the scope of `i`.
6. The program will never reach line 12, since it will crash at line 11. If the code in line 11 was deleted, then we will get a ReferenceError, since `discountedPrice` was declared using the `let` keyword inside the for loop. The `console.log` statement is outside the for loop, and is therefore outside the scope of `discountedPrice`. 
7. The program will never reach line 13, since it will crash at line 11. If the code in lines 11 and 12 was deleted, then line 13 will print the value of `finalPrice` calculated during the final iteration of the for loop. This is because `finalPrice` was declared in the function's block using the `let` keyword, so the `console.log` statement is in the scope of the variable.
8. The function will never return a value, since the program will crash on line 11. If the code in lines 11 and 12 was deleted, the function will return `[50, 100, 150]`. This is because the variable `discounted` is initialized as an empty array. Then for each iteration of the loop, the discount is applied to the price and the final rounded price is pushed to the back of the array. Changing the variable declaration from a `var` declaration to a `let` declaration does not affect the output.
9. Running the function would result in a TypeError in line 7. Therefore, the statement on line 11 would not be reached. If there was no error, line 11 would print the last value of `i`, which would be equal to `prices.length`.
10. Running the function would result in a TypeError in line 7. Therefore, the statement on line 12 would not be reached. If there was no error earlier, this statement would cause an error, since the `discountedPrice` variable was declared in the for loop using the `const` keyword, which means that its scope is the for loop. The `console.log` statement is outside that code block, causing an error.
11. Running the function would result in a TypeError in line 7. Therefore, the statement on line 13 would not be reached. If there were no errors caused earlier, this statement would print 0, since the `finalPrice` variable is declared at the beginning of the function, which means its scope is the function block. It is a constant variable, so its value cannot be changed, which means its value is 0.
12. Running the function would result in a TypeError in line 7. Therefore, the function would not return a value, since the return statement would not be reached. If there are no errors cause before the return statement, the function will return `[0, 0, 0]`. This is because the variable `discounted` is initialized as an empty array, and then the value of `finalPrice` is pushed on to the array for each iteration of the for loop. Since there is no assignment to the array, only modification of the array, the constant value 0 that is assigned to `finalPrice` is pushed to the array for each value in `prices`.
