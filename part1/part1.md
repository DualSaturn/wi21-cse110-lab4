1. At line 11, the last value of `i` will be printed, which will be equal to `prices.length`. This is because `i` was declared using the `var` keyword, and therefore has the entire function as its scope.
2. At line 12, the value of `discountedPrice` calculated during the last iteration of the loop will be printed. This is because `discountedPrice` was declared using the `var` keyword, and therefore has the entire function as its scope.
3. At line 13, the value of `finalPrice` calculated during the last iteration of the loop will be printed. This is because `finalPrice` was declared using the `var` keyword and was declared in the function's block. Therefore, it has the entire function as its scope.
4. The function will return `[50, 100, 150]`. This is because the variable `discounted` is initialized as an empty array. Then for each iteration of the loop, the discount is applied to the price and the final rounded price is pushed to the back of the array.
5. At line 11, we will get a ReferenceError, since `i` was declared using the `let` keyword inside the for loop. The `console.log` statement is outside the for loop, and is therefore outside the scope of `i`.
6. The program will never reach line 12, since it will crash at line 11. If the code in line 11 was deleted, then we will get a ReferenceError, since `discountedPrice` was declared using the `let` keyword inside the for loop. The `console.log` statement is outside the for loop, and is therefore outside the scope of `discountedPrice`. 
7. The program will never reach line 13, since it will crash at line 11. If the code in lines 11 and 12 was deleted, then line 13 will print the value of `finalPrice` calculated during the final iteration of the for loop. This is because `finalPrice` was declared in the function's block using the `let` keyword, so the `console.log` statement is in the scope of the variable.
8. The function will never return a value, since the program will crash on line 11. If the code in lines 11 and 12 was deleted, the function will return `[50, 100, 150]`. This is because the variable `discounted` is initialized as an empty array. Then for each iteration of the loop, the discount is applied to the price and the final rounded price is pushed to the back of the array. Changing the variable declaration from a `var` declaration to a `let` declaration does not affect the output.
9. Running the function would result in a TypeError in line 7. Therefore, the statement on line 11 would not be reached.
10. Running the function would result in a TypeError in line 7. Therefore, the statement on line 12 would not be reached.
11. Running the function would result in a TypeError in line 7. Therefore, the statement on line 13 would not be reached.
12. No clue what to write - awaiting further clarifications
